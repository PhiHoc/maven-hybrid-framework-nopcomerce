# Selenium Hybrid Framework for NopCommerce
## Overview
This Selenium Hybrid Framework is designed for automated testing of the NopCommerce website. It combines the advantages of data-driven and keyword-driven testing approaches to provide a flexible and scalable solution for automated testing.

## Framework Structure
### 1. Core Components:
 * Common packages: Contains common classes and constants used across the framework.
   - Base Page: Encapsulates methods to interact with web elements such as clicking, typing text, selecting options, verifying element presence, etc. Serves as the foundation for all page objects.
   - Base Test: Provides the setup and teardown configurations required for test execution. It initializes WebDriver, configures the browser environment, handles errors or failures, etc. Serves as the foundation for all test classes.
   - Base Component: Similar to Base Page but at a more granular level. It represents reusable components within a web page, such as a header, footer, navigation menu, or any other UI component that appears across multiple pages.
   - Common Register: Register a user account as a common precondition for test cases.
   - Global Constants: Store constant values that are used throughout the framework.
   - Page Generator Manager: Managing generating Page Objects.
 * Page Objects: Contains page classes representing different pages of the NopCommerce website. Each page class encapsulates the elements and actions on that page.
 * Page User Interface: Contains page UI classes that manage element locators of a page. Each page in the application under test has its own corresponding Page Object class and Page UI class.
 * Utilities: Contains utility classes for common functionalities such as reading data from Excel files, logging, and handling browser configurations.
 * Page Factory: A design pattern to initialize the browser environment. Allowing tests to be executed on different browsers without modifying the test code.
### 2. Test Component
 * Test Classes: Includes test case classes containing the actual test methods. These test methods utilize page objects to interact with the web elements and perform the test steps.
 * Data Classes: Containing test data in a constant variable form. It included profile data such as name, email, country, city, phone number, etc.
### 3. XML Configuration Files
* log4j.xml: Configure logging for test classes
* run*.xml: Custom XML file for running test cases.
### 4. Reports
* Allure reports: Provides detailed and visually appealing test reports. Execution results are stored in the 'allure-json' directory.
## How to Run Tests with XML File
1. Clone or download the Selenium Hybrid Framework repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Update the run*.xml file in the test resources directory with appropriate configuration settings such as browser type, environment, etc.
4. Right-click on the run*.xml file to run it as a TestNG suite.
5. TestNG will execute the test suites defined in the XML file and display the test results in the console.
6. After test execution, you can view detailed test reports by executing the 'allureReport.bat' file
